Date of stay: December 2022,50,Excellent customer services,I‚Äôve received excellent and courteous services from all the staffs from checking in to housekeeping. Will definitely stay here again next time we visit Saigon. Room is nice and comfy. Staffs were very attentive to my needs
Date of stay: December 2022,10,"Park Hyatt, where's the passion?","We went to Park Lounge to enjoy breakfast and it was completely a sh**show. No SOP, employees ran around like headless chickens. Manning is a big big problem. They didn't mind clearing the tables. (pictured) They raised the bar of arrogance too high. Their doorman never smiles or greets guests. You can check because I tested them by stopping for 5 seconds and staring at them. They acted like robot: no smiles, no greetings. What a Hyatt way! No item confirmation after order, dishes placed to wrong person. Look at the picture attached, one of the chopstick even fall down after the waitress placing it on the table. At least a dish should be used instead of putting the cloth on the table which is not cleaned/cleared frequently with their inadequate manning. No smiles, employees were cold, slow and did not show any passion. Such a nice place with very inviting Christmas dec√≥r but it ends there. Maybe being and staying arrogant is the new way of hospitality? Look at what happened to Hyatt Hanoi!!!"
Date of stay: December 2022,50,Everything I thought it would be,"Charming and beautiful hotel near everything right in the center of Saigon city. Friendly staff, beautiful room. We only stayed 2 nights, but I would recommend and stay again. I really hate that it makes you put 200 word minimum on reviews."
Date of stay: December 2022,50,beautiful hotel and excellent service,"very pleasant stay. Extremely professional service, from the front office manager (Patrick) and Guest Experience service (Hang). There was some error from the booking and Hang even helped us to reach out to Hyatt US for the issue. The room is beautifully decorated and great view as well."
Date of stay: December 2022,50,Extraordinary,"I stayed in Pak Hyatt for a week in December 2022. Everything was just beyond my best expectations. Combination of luxury, comfort, absolutely sensational service and extraordinary food. Would strongly recommend and will definitely stay there again."
Date of stay: December 2022,50,Just great,"I could not expect more. The location is wonderful and the service at Hyatt is excellent. The amenities are great and the staff are so helpful. Loan, the housekeeping staff, helped me a lot with my packing upon check-out. I will definitely come back to this hotel whenever I visit Ho Chi Minh city."
Date of stay: December 2022,50,Awesome experience At Park Hyatt,"Located in a very strategic place if you‚Äôre looking for nice coffee shops, shops, restaurants. Easy access, nice surroundings to walk around. Breakfast is awesome! Cleanliness as usual, ‚ÄúPark Hyatt‚Äù world class. Fitness facilities and pool are great and well maintained."
Date of stay: December 2022,50,Great Park Hyatt,"A great hotel in a great location. I haven‚Äôt stayed at this property over 3 years due to pandemic. However, they still remember to stock up my bathroom amenities preference. A little touch like that makes a difference. The room feels luxurious and elegant without going overboard. Highly recommend. Book thru Amex FHR to get better benefits."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,"A wonderful, refined Park Hyatt property","If I'm being frank I wasn't expecting to like the Park Hyatt Saigon as much as I did. I'm a big Park Hyatt fan but from photos the PHS looks quite muted in tone. Perhaps that's because I was likely mentally comparing it to its more outlandish neighbor in the area, The Reverie. I couldn't have been more wrong. Immediately upon walking in, the grand yet understated lobby has a wonderful scene of occasion. Fantastic service across the board, especially at the front desk. The rooms are excellent with superlative attention to detail and a lovely design sensibility. The bathroom are spacious with a tub and shower area that is nicely done, while perhaps not rivaling the combo in a property like the PH Washington DC. There are some great details in the room like the mini bar and the writing desk which elevates the room and gives it a sense of place. The pool, while not having a view like some other properties in Saigon, is large while feeling intimate at the same time, due to how the pool is framed. The service at the pool was friendly and humorous. The drinks could be a wee bit stronger but overall thumbs up.  The bar 2 Lam Son at the PH is a small yet stunning dual level space, with dark wood, seductive lighting and excellent drinks. It feels very much in it's own element. Our experience dining at the property was limited, as we were eating with friends in other districts. I will say the Yuzu Cheescake from the bakery was delicious and a visual treat.  I wouldn't call the PHS a pure ""showstopper"" so-to-speak but it's a top-notch, visually distinctive, refined, tasteful and extremely well located hotel in a gorgeous building (especially at night) next to the Opera House.  Absolutely recommend and would stay again next time we're in Saigon."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,awesome,"wonderful experience. My room had even a fruit, staff was great and helpful. Very nice indeed. The pool waiter offered me a fruit treat. I liked the breakfast very much and the way room was designed also. There is also a lively bar inside the hotel, which was a pleasurable surprise, and a nice lobby with live music and a singer. Very cool."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Perfection in Saigon,The Park Hyatt in Saigon is an outstanding hotel. It‚Äôs traditional. Great location in District 1.  We are just completing a 16 night stay.  If you are looking for a hotel where the service is perfect and where people will genuinely care about you then this is your place.  The rooms are large. The breakfast buffet and menu are amazing: the pool area and spa are great: the concierge is üíØ.  You all know the platitudes. From the moment of our check in to the arrangements for our transport to the airport tomorrow: we have been treated so well.  We have enjoyed our stay. Thank you PH for your hospitality!
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Classy great hotel,"Everything impeccable, great quality and services. Fastest check in ever, room and bathroom very clean, good amenities and sleeping quality. Convenient location, offered luxury car services from/to airport"
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Wonderful Experience,"I stayed 4 nights, and everything was perfect. I would stay here again. Highly recommended.  Mattress was high quality. Shower water pressure was good. It's got everything a 5 star luxury hotel is supposed to offer. Best of all are the staff. They responded quickly to my requests. The front desk and the doorman ever remembered me after a couple of interactions."
Date of stay: November 2022,30,Lackluster service,"Normally I love anything Hyatt. Felt that the hotel transport (from airport to hotel ‚Äîwhich there was an incident ) to the room provided- were all subpar. The lady who was helping me was giving quite unhelpful answers- and I could sense she couldn‚Äôt care less what I thought or needed. Honestly, I was a bit shocked for how lackluster the welcoming experience was (compared to other Park Hyatt locations. ) In any case - the start to my stay was disappointing to say the least. The end of the stay slightly redeemed the poor start - but would rather stay somewhere you can feel good from beginning if the stay to the end."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,"Excellent hotel clean and very friendly staff,awesome breakfast","I was glad we were in this hotel,it‚Äôs very close to everything shopping,restaurants,and the staff are very polite and helpful and my room is very clean,I will stay here again..would recommend it to my friends and family. I definitely enjoyed the buffet breakfast,wide selection of Asian and American dishes"
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Continue to be wonderful,"This was our 10th stay in 6 years. Continue to be one of our favourite hotels globally and while the staff have changed due to COVID, it continues to provide wonderful service and a great place to stay. The new crew is young and has a beautiful energy level so any mistakes can be easily forgotten.  It has a new wine sommelier, Thanh, a local. A fantastic move by the hotel as he is very good and I hope he does become the first Vietnamese MW."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Oasis in Saigon,"Our stay at the Park Hyatt in Ho Chi Min City was an exceptional experience. The rooms were lovely, the lobby bar had afternoon tea with piano and violin music and the breakfast buffet had the best croissants outside of Paris. We would highly recommend it for all international travelers."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,A fabulous location in the heart of Ho Chi Minh ciry,"What a great place to stay if you want all of the hassle of travelling taken away. After sightseeing in the hot humid city returning to this hotel was a sanctuary of calm cool delight. It is well located in the city so we were able to walk to most of the sights we wanted to see, and the tours that took us outside the city were private and well organised by the concierge. I whole heartedly recommend this hotel."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Just Great,"Staffs are all super friendly. Pool was great, room was clean, and breakfast was fresh and delicious. Love the cold coconut water & the freshly baked croissant. Bed was very comfortable, wifi is fast enough for video calls."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Luxury Hotel in Prime Location,"First class hotel with wonderful staff and accommodations. Located in district 1 was in perfect location to main city center. About 30 minutes from the airport. Staff are extremely courteous and helpful. Stay here, you won‚Äôt regret it."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Great Hotel Experence,The Hotels is one of the top class hotel I've every stayed. I had a great experience during my stay. Wonderful people & staff. I would recommend for any one to stay at Park Hyatt. Food could be improved to be more Asian

Simply amazing in every way!,"Warm welcome with stunning passion fruit cake, flowers and welcome note for our honeymoon - check! Surprise birthday cake - check! Excellent food - check! Wonderful rooms with lots of hidden features from the nespresso machine to the lovely toiletries - check! Extremely professional, helpful and kind staff (from porters to receptionists, to chefs, to cleaners, everybody!!) - check!

This hotel is beautiful and has everything you could possibly need, all meals are very well catered for, there is live music entertainment in the evenings in the lounge and the 3rd floor pool is bliss! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
Date of stay: November 2022,30,Outstanding Breakfast buffet but service with room for improvement,"On the positive side - location is great, very central - outstanding breakfast - really comfortable beds - nice bars  Room for improvement: - limited appreciation towards globalist members - guest communication"
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Great stay,"Great location, and very helpful, friendly staff. Hotel very nice and luxurious. We only had breakfast at the hotel, which was a large selection of Asian and Western food, and was very tasty. Would recommend."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Excellent experience,This hotel is 5 star all the way. Beautiful spacious rooms. The lobby is a welcoming space for afternoon tea or cocktails. Breakfast is bountiful. The location is perfect in central Saigon. The staff is very helpful
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Luxurious Start to a Long SE Asia Trip,"We chose the Park Hyatt Saigon as a nice spot for getting over jet lag and for enjoying some touring. It was a great decision. From the moment we walked into the gorgeous lobby with beautiful live flowers and a warm, Professional welcome from the staff, we knew we had made the right choice.  The pool was lovely with nice lunch and drink service. The gym is very nice with a good size and good equipment. The breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious. One minor point was that the staff at breakfast was stretched thin but I am sure that‚Äôs a post-COVID ramp up problem. In the evening, the cocktail lounge had pleasant live music.  Our room, a Park Suite, was luxurious and kept spotlessly clean. The bathroom is large.  I highly recommend booking through Amex Platinums Fine Hotels and Resorts program to get a few extra perks.  We would highly recommend this beautiful hotel to all."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Favorite hotel in Saigon,"Spent 3 weeks in Saigon hotels. The Reverie and Intercontinental are fine, but The Park Hyatt Saigon has been my favorite for years. There is an understated elegance to this place. It doesn‚Äôt try to show off. It isn‚Äôt gaudy. When I walk into the Park Hyatt, I immediately feel it‚Äôs calming influence. I wish all hotels were as good."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Wonderful hotel,This is a gorgeous hotel with beautiful public rooms decorated with gorgeous flower arrangements. It has a lovely pool area. Service is good. It provides a plentiful breakfast and has a vibey bar and quiet large lounge area. We had a large king sized room that was luxuriously decorated and space to unpack and shelves in the bathroom as well as a place to plug in electronics in the bathroom ( finally a room where I could use my flat iron in front of a mirror) and plugs available by each nightstand. The towels were large and soft. The room had a desk with chair and a comfortable lounge chair. Air conditioning and shower were good. The hotel is located in a posh part of town. This room had everything you would need for a comfortable 4 day stay. I would highly recommend this hotel.
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Great stay,"Excellent quality stay, very convenient location, close to the Opera and the river side, friendly dedicated staff in every position, rooms are clean and of high standard. Food is delicious, very nice pool to relax in."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Incredible hotel !,"My wife and I just completed our stay at this extraordinary hotel. I travel very frequently in Asia and I put the Park Hyatt at the top of the list. Beautiful rooms, food, extraordinary service, and concierge, beautiful artwork, a grand feeling all the way around. I needed to make a change to my reservation and the management and concierge handled it all promptly and professionally. VERY IMPRESSED!!!"
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Excellent hotel well placed in centre of Saigon,Plenty of variety at breakfast as this excellent hotel. Coffee wasn‚Äôt strong enough but overall it was a great experience. Staff were very helpful and everything went smoothly. I would definitely stay again when returning‚Ä¶
Date of stay: November 2022,50,1 night in paradise,really a fantastic hotel in the very center of Saigon ! the swimming pool open til 8 pm is really big and very well served by very professional staff m. The rooms are marvelous: absolutely recommendable
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Beautiful hotel in a central location,"Park Hyatt is a high end hotel with beautiful decorations. You can tell that every little detail is carried out with the utmost attention. The hotel is within walking distance to restaurants, shops, malls, etc‚Ä¶ Breakfast buffet offers a lot of variety but caters more to a Westernized clientele rather than Asian. Ordering from a menu however takes a long time, sometimes between 30-45 minutes so keep that in mind if you are in a rush. Overall excellent stay."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,THE Place to Stay in Saigon,"Could not have been better. A virtual oasis in the city. The staff is flawless and make it all look easy. Rooms are clean, elegant and well stocked. It's an upscale hotel but totally worth it if you want a really luxurious experience. We would stay there again for sure."
Date of stay: November 2022,50,Amazing stay at the Park Hyatt Saigon,"After a few years of travel, I returned to the Park Hyatt Saigon. What an amazing experience I had. The standard of the hotel is top-notch and the serivce / attention to fine details is just AMAZING... I really did not want the trip to end. The staff are well trained to treat you like Royalty. Can't wait to be back at the Park Hyatt Saigon..."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Park Hyatt Saigon,"Excellent customer relations and care especially while I was unwell with Covid. The staff made a point of knowing my name and making sure I had everything I needed and took the time to check I was ok on a regular basis form rooms service, cleaners and managers."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,A beautiful experience,As soon as you walk into the perfectly located Hyatt you feel the luxury of this beautifully appointed hotel. The Opera provided an excellent breakfast and casual lunch but it was the Park Lounge that particularly appealed. Sitting there in the evening listening to some fabulous live music with drinks and nibbles provided a relaxing sanctuary from the madness of Saigon. Large comfortable rooms and great service what more could you ask.
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Simply the best,"Park Hyatt Saigon set the bar at record heights. We have diamond status at two other hotel chains starting with letters H and M, and the minimum with World of Hyatt. Never have I received the level of attention that the folks at Park Hyatt provided. Several days before check in, the front desk manager Mr. Patrick Grob reached out with detailed instructions to inform us and make our transit as smooth as possible. Mr. Tan Nguyen, leader of reservations, was able to arrange an earlier check in since we were transferring between hotels. All this well before we'd even set foot on the property or made any requests. This doesn't happen with any other hotel.  Moments of joy continued as we were greeted with some beautiful flowers and tasty dried mango snacks in the room. There's a stately old money luxury feel despite modern touches. Rich heavy furnishings, plenty of cups and glasses for coffee or tea, and super thick towels.  Room service hit the mark as well. Bacon was sliced so thinly it was translucent, eggs cooked to perfection. Spring rolls and beef noodles on point. I wished the carafe kept the broth warmer, it wasn't hot enough on arrival. But we've noticed that with every 5-star hotel we ordered from. So perhaps the temperature is due to safety concerns. I just like my pho, bun bo, hu tieu, piping hot.  After two wonderful nights, it was hard to leave for the airport. We'll return for sure."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Ultimate relaxation and outstanding service,"Hotel was great and staff made it even better. I would give a 5 star hotel a sixth star just for the service and feeling like they took effort to know me. I have dietary issue with milk protein, and i had to mention it once and after that all restaurants knew me and prepared everything for me to fit me. They really allowed me to relax and not worry! Everything worked, like airport transfers as once requested, i never had to make initiative to double check myself, they remembered and arranged everything ready, and kept me well informed. Stellar place."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Very Grand,Delightful stay in this vibrant city. Great location and welcoming staff. Food in the Opera was good but the Square One dinner was the best if our trip in all if Vietnam. Room bed was comfortable. Beautiful decor everywhere.
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Full Park experience from a to z,Great Service from the driver at the airport all the way to the check out. F&B is great and special mention to the choice of scotch at the Martini Bar and quality of food at Square one. Simply said; BRAVO !
Date of stay: October 2022,50,"Great hotel, great location","The hotel was highly recommended by my colleagues and it exceeded the expectations by far. We had issues with the arrival date, and the hotel was very responsive in accommodating all our needs. We‚Äôll defiantly return again."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Visiting Saigon from NYC,"Having a great time staying at PH- my home for 4 nights. Professional and friendly staffs at the reception, main entrance, gyms, the opera breakfast, and LamSon Bar. Best location in District 1. Will definitely come back."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Hugo Huynh,"The hotel are Very clean and good hospitality. We love the staffs services. They did very good job and cares with everything, I rated the management was very good, because the way staffs worked was very professional"
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Oasis of tranquility,The park Hyatt Saigon is by far the best hotel in the city of Saigon. From the moment we arrived to the time of check out everything was perfect. The breakfast had an outstanding section of both Western and Asian cuisine and the service impeccable. Afternoon tea at the Park longe was also a highlight of our stay with luxurious surrounding and delicious treats. The pool was the perfect oasis of tranquility to unwind after a long day of sightseeing.
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Absolutely out of this world hotel,This was one of the most luxurious hotel that I have ever stayed in. The room d√©cor and the amenities in the room were second to none. An excellent spread of buffet for breakfast. A must visit and stay hotel.
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Amazing hotel and friendly staff,"Amazing hotel , we loved the location. Shopping centre is nearby, staf very helpful and friendly. Breakfast is super yummy. Dinner at Opera is very delicious especially Barramundi fish with warm quinoa .Room is very comfortable and cozy. Everything just what we need . Highly recommended."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,The Best hotel in Saigon,"Every time i visit Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), i always decide to stay at the Park Hyatt Saigon. The facilities and decorations in the rooms are fantastic and so vintage. The hotel have a great location in the middle of the town. The hotel staff are friendly and always ready to support. The breakfast is a lovely place to have an early morning meal. The hotel lounge is one of the best in town and even in Vietnam, live music, great service, good selection of tea and hot drinks, as well as desserts. In general, it is home away from home."
Date of stay: October 2022,50,Great stay at the Park Hyatt in Saigon,"Stayed here for 3 nights, 4 days. Service was impeccable throughout my stay. From the front desk, door men, waiters/waitresses, and housekeepers, all made sure my stay was a pleasant experience. Also, spent some time at the pool for my stay and the attendant there, Tan, was very hospitable in my stay and very accommodating. Overall, the staff seemed all on the same page and would highly recommend a stay here for the experience!"
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Home away from home,"Welcomed back to Park Hyatt and as always, staff super helpful; management made time to say hi to me and chat. Truly an amazing hotel, amazing service and amazing staff who know me and my preferences very well. Extremely professional and helpful staff."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Best location best staff,"Upon arrival to this gorgeous property we were treated with kindness and warm greetings. We were upgraded to the corner suite which was much larger than it seemed in the pictures online. Booking through the Amex fine hotels program we were greeted with a bottle of wine, fruit bowl, dried fruit selection, sparkling water, and a box of fine chocolates along with a $100 hotel credit for food and daily free drink cards from 5-7. The hotels location is behind the opera house and next to several historical sites and prime shopping. I‚Äôve read some reviews that guests felt the they may have not been treated to their satisfaction and as a person that just rolled of the street in a baseball cap, tshirt and shorts I must say I was treated like royalty. So if you find that you‚Äôre not ok with the way you‚Äôre treated with this staff then you should check one of their beautifully ornate and oversized mirrors."
Date of stay: September 2022,40,Wedding Dinner at Park Hyatt,"Just had my wedding dinner party at Park Hyatt ballroom.My family and guests arrive from Singapore,Thailand,Japan.I have to book hotel rooms for them and I put them to stay at Park Hyatt.They were happy to stay at the hotel and enjoy the excellent service from the staffs.Breakfast service was fantastic. Well done !!! We will come back to join your hospitably and services. Robin"
Date of stay: September 2022,20,Poor service at the Lounge,"During Sunday lunch at the Lounge, I had a very unpleasant experience waiting for a long time for the table and food. Some tables were empty and I was told the guests had booked and paid for the high tea in advance. Hence, I was asked to wait for few minutes at the bench in front of lounge while they said they are clearing up table. After more than 15 minutes, I went up to the staff and asked if the table is ready and said there was no table available. Then I asked why asked me to wait for them to clear the tables and they have the audacity to say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say the table will be ready in few minutes‚Äù. So I asked what‚Äôs next and they recommend I go to business Center with the menu and wait, which I did. After 15 mins or so, they came back and told me a table has been prepared. So they ushered me to the table and they didn‚Äôt take my order immediately. I had to wait for them to be available and call them before the order can be taken. Once the order was taken, I waited for more than 30 mins but the food has not yet arrived. So I asked the staff and they went to check and said will be ready in 15 mins time and I continue to wait. It was another 20 minutes and I asked where is the food. The staff went to the kitchen and came back to me and said will be ready in 2 minutes. So I thought the food is finally ready. But after 5 minutes, I asked them where is my food and said the food wasn‚Äôt ready and ask me to wait again. I was frustrated by the whole event of asking and following up with them on the status of my order. I had some works to do and I requested that when the food ready, have them sent to my room asap. While I was working on my emails in the room, I was wondering why it took so long for them to bring the food to my room. I sensed that the staff may not understand my instructions, so I quickly contacted front office manager for assistance and see if there was anyone who could clearly understand what I wanted. Finally after clarifications with the F&B team, they did deliver the food but the whole saga could have been avoided as long as the staff are well trained, alert and understand how to work. I also realised the workload at the lounge is not that intense compared to the cafe or the restaurant upstairs. Perhaps it is an opportunity for the team at the lounge to swap their duty with the team at the cafe or restaurant so that they can learn and be up to speed on attending orders."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Great location,"The hotel was great and the location was perfect. We could walk and walk, which was very refreshing coming from Manila. If you are new to Vietnam, could not think of a better place to start. Thanks to all the staff who were so very helpful."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,One of the Best Hotel in Asia,Service always perfect. Perfect location in Ho Chi Mihn City. Great rooms and so nice to use the Swimming Pool at 6.00 am when city is waking up. I will definitely come back to stay in Park Hyatt when I travel to Saigon.
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Best place to stay in Saigon,"Above expectation stay. Perfect property, well trained and responsive staff. Opera (restaurant) had the best fried squid (10/10) you can have anywhere. Pizza leaves something to be desired (4/10) . Tough to get a Spa appointment so book well in advance. Was really keen to try it out as I heard a lot of good things about the Spa"
Date of stay: September 2022,50,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Staff - Having Hyatt Status doesnt get you much here","Property already has excellent rooms, service, decor, and staff.  The World of Hyatt program is pretty much useless here given the bar being already so high. You wont feel special as a member.  This is my second time staying here and would stay again."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Very Nice Stay in Ho Chi Min,"Always Stay here whenever I am in Saigon. Very Nice Rooms and Spacious Bathroom, Good Location, Staff Friendliness and Helpful. Breakfast is very good. The hotel has good vibe at the lounge for meeting friends and afternoon tea. Highly Recommended"
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Amazing,"Amazing experience, could not fault anything. The staff were amazing and very accommodating. The ambiance was magnificent. Location was just fantastic. Would definitely stay again. The restaurant was absolutely wonderful and breakfast was delightful."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Wonderful Hotel,"I travel to Asia frequently and stay at many of the leading hotels, but my stay at the Park Hyatt in HCMC was memorable. The hotel is a beautiful, stately building, and the rooms feel welcoming. The staff is where the hotel shines. They were friendly and attentive and anticipated my needs, especially during breakfast. Wonderful stay"
Date of stay: September 2022,50,A Model in Excellence that All Park Hyatt Hotels Should Aspire to,"By far my favorite Park Hyatt not just in Vietnam, but the entire world. The hotel and its facilities are beautiful, yes, but it's their team that goes above and beyond in making sure each stay feels like a home away from home. They'll learn and anticipate your needs and do everything they can to take care of you. Highly recommended."
Date of stay: September 2022,40,Overall good but room for improvement,"Pros: clean rooms, helpful light switches and good bfast, beautiful lobby  Cons: standard rooms are abit small, due for a refresh. Service is ok. Minor gripes: left a piece of laundry on the bed when I left, came back and it was tossed aside instead of folded. Guess I might be spoiled by st Regis but that's what I benchmark with park Hyatt. Overall a pleasant stay in the room but I guess I feel no one did anything that was the extra mile"
Date of stay: September 2022,50,excellent hotel with great service,"Great location. Given the traffic in Saigon, this location is conveniently accessible to taxi and walking distance to many restaurants. While it is pricey for Vietnam standard, the service is probably closest to the 5 star experience comparable to Europe or America and worth the premium. Staffs are nice and knowledgable. Would be nice if the restaurant offer Vietnamese food."
Date of stay: August 2022,50,What a classic Pary Hyatt !,"It's a gorgeous hotel in HCMC ! The service is amiable ! Great restaurants and very friendly staff ! I went to Square One to try almost all their signature dishes. I shall never forget my favorite dessert, the coconut ice-cream lollipops !"
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Excellent service and location,Special thanks for the service & support from the Patrick Grob & his Front Desk team; also to the Restaurant team for helping to arrange and prepare our family banquets. Will be back in future. Highly recommended for major family occasion and gatherings. Highly appreciated the exemplary & professional guests-oriented service. Thank you Hyatt Saigon !

Plenty on offer for their breakfast options and to top if off great coffee! Perfectly located, within walking distance to all major sites. Would highly recommend this hotel for both business or leisure travel."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,A home away from home,"Overall the experience staying in this hotel far exceed my expectations with regards to the cleanliness, ambience, quality of the sleeping bed, toilets and even the deco! A minor comment though is that the coffee area near the lobby is often n occupied by outsiders (eg hookers, etc) and no section is cordoned off for in house hotel guess to conduct meet and greet."
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Wonderful stay at Park Hyatt Saigon,"My stay at Park Hyatt Saigon has been great. Special thanks to Ms. Tran, Ms. Thao and the front office team, who went above and beyond to show great hospitality skills during my stay. The front office team in Park Hyatt Saigon made my stay in Vietnam a memorable experience."
Date of stay: September 2022,10,Will Never Stay At This Hotel Again,Hotel pads the bill. Management is ineffective. Room is dated. Way too expensive for the experience. Avoid this location and go to one of the other hotels in same area. Tired of being cheated by this location after experiencing the same thing on multiple stays. Review your bill and will likely find more expenses than expected.
Date of stay: September 2022,50,Love it,It was a great experience with amazing drink and nice almosphere. I love the view from inside as u can see how busy and beauty of the city The staffs are helpful and welcoming. We are all happy with our friday night. Cozy and luxury in the center.

Square one, evening dinner was again exceptional, great service and exceptional food.  Overall I was actually blown away by the whole experience and offering at Park Hyatt Saigon - in my Opinion the staff and cuisine, made this surpass other Park Hyatt hotels I have experienced in Sydney & Milan, but to put simply Park Hyatt Saigon was a different level - the food across all offerings was some of the best I have tasted anywhere in the world. Overall very well done and I look forward to return. Thank you"

Date of stay: June 2022,10,Bad service,We spent our holiday in hotel and wanted to book a table for afternoon tea. But the staff kept saying no table available until i had to tell them i stayed in hotel. Then the manager said she could arrange a table for us. During the breakfast we had to wait and ask to clean our table which is not a high standard should be. Definitely very bad experience

Date of stay: August 2022,50,The Perfect Depiction of What Park Hyatt Property Should Be,"One of the best Hyatt Property in Asia. The location itself is superb, right in the heart of District 1 close to everything you can imagine. Most of the parks and monuments are within walking distance from the hotel, and so does Cafes and a multitude of restaurants the heart desires. Even when booking through points, we were upgrades to suites on the 9th (highest) floor with our Globalist status. Here is a perfect example of how status should work. We got off our flight and got to the hotel at 11AM and was given a spare room as the suite was being serviced. The staff did not have to give us the spare room, but the fact that they did speaks to how tentative and good-will they have to customers. The suite was amazing and expected from Park Hyatt properties. There was even complimentary wine and an assortment of dried fruits awaiting for us. I cannot emphasize enough of how professional and exemplary the staff were."
Date of stay: August 2022,20,Could Have Been Better,"We discovered a gecko in our room wandering freely on 5th August. We informed Guest Service which is helpful to chase the gecko out of the room. I had sent an email to Front Desk on 6th August to inform about this incident and they were nice to offer a room upgrade for 7th August which I declined as I am checking out on 8th August and it is inconvenient to pack and unpack my luggage. They also offered a free head, shoulder and neck massage. I have requested for the free massage to be changed to a full body massage with discounted rate and I will pay for the service. The Front Office was helpful to change it to a 1-for-1 offer for all spa packages. An appointment was booked at 4pm on 7th August and the Spa Team was copied via email.  On 7th August at around 1540 hrs, we received an in room call from the Spa Team that they wish to change our appointment if we want a full body massage to 20 00 hrs. or to the 8th August as they are not available, citing the reason that they did not see the email timely. We politely rejected them as the notice to change came 15 minutes BEFORE our appointment and we had made prior plans. The Spa Team then informed that they will make the necessary arrangement. When we arrived at the Spa, we wanted to book a 90-minutes full body massage but we were TOLD that ONLY 60-minute packages are available despite the email saying that we are offered 1-for-1 for spa packages. At this juncture, I am simply too exuberated with disappointment that I just accepted what is ""offered"".  I wish to highlight that it is not our duty to ensure that there is effective internal communication among the various hotel departments that resulted in this unpleasant experience.  We visit HCM often to visit my my in-laws and my stay with Park Hyatt is certainly the most unpleasant and disappointing."
Date of stay: August 2022,50,Above and beyond.,We stayed at the Park Hyatt for 2 nights. The hotel is in a great location to explore Saigon. It is a wonderful place to come back to from a day of exploring the local atteactions. There ate many great restaurants and cafes nearby. The hotel staffs are extremely helpful and courteous.

Date of stay: July 2022,50,Great place to stay,The property was clean. Check in process was quick and prompt with staff who were all able to converse well and fluently in English. Would have loved more food choices though. But it‚Äôs central so that is not a huge issue.

Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Exceptional Service, As Always",I always have a great experience when staying here. The service is best in class and the team is warm and genuinely hospitable. The property is also maintained very well. I've been coming here for 10+ years and it still looks like it was built last year. I can't recommend the hotel enough for a consistently exceptional experience.
Date of stay: July 2022,50,"Great location, beautiful property, terrific staff",Nothing better than coming in from a hot day of sightseeing to this perfect in every way hotel. Can't recommend this hotel enough. And our garden terrace room by the pool was the icing on the cake! The staff went out fo their way to make our stay everything we could have possibly wanted.
Date of stay: July 2022,20,Not for families - not for holidays‚Ä¶. what a disappointment. :(,"Amazing building, as you enter the lobby it certainly has the ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor. We stayed here for 2 nights after a long family holiday in northern vietnam before flying home to HK.  On arrival I was so impressed by the building that we happily paid (an extra $400 a night) to upgraded to one of the larger suites. The executive suite was beautiful ‚Äî as were the fresh flowers, wine and the martini mixer they left in the room.  It‚Äôs possible that the great start caused high expectations but whatever the case we we‚Äôre left THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED. So much so that i‚Äôm writing my first ever review here.  Mistakes happen in life (as for sure they do in my business ) and i hate reading reviews that focus on a small mistake here or there. It‚Äôs the overall experience that should be judged, not one or two low points.  The problem here was the whole experience left me and my wife thoroughly disappointed. Great service is making hard requests look simple - this hotel was the absolute opposite - anything you asked of them was way too much trouble.  We‚Äôre a family of three (4 yr old daughter) so don‚Äôt want anything fancy but we‚Äôre really disappointed that almost every request we had was met with a NO.  For example the afternoon tea is served in the lobby with a dressy crowd - we asked if we could possibly have it served 10 feet away in their casual restaurant as i didn‚Äôt want my wife to feel uncomfortable if my daughter made to much noise ‚ÄúNO‚Äù Similarly we walked in the building post dinner with my daughter was asleep in our arms and my wife didn‚Äôt feel well so asked for a paracetamol. ‚ÄúNO‚Äù go across the road and buy one was the message. Similar issues happened with taxi hailing, umbrella useage, housekeeping and room service to name a few‚Ä¶. (huge sigh‚Ä¶)  When asked a second or third time of course someone said we could have the scones served just a few feet away. Similarly after my daughter had been woken up by the back and forth and was crying they quickly offered some paracetamol etc.  The issue is they just didn‚Äôt make us feel welcome at all and the hotel just does NOT seem set up to look after families. It‚Äôs such a waste of a beautiful building and amazing rooms (although breakfast was great).  DO NOT GO AS A FAMILY, and don‚Äôt expect a premium service for a premium room. They need to get their act together with the MO being build across the street.  To top it all off i asked for the manager (after i‚Äôd paid the bill etc) just to highlight some issues as our car to the airport was running late. The concierge made us feel very comfortable again as to why we should call for a manager.  Nice guy came out and said sorry and was also sorry that it was too late to do anything for us. We didn‚Äôt ask for anything ‚Ä¶ i just explained why we had such a negative experience.  He waited till our car arrived and opened the door for us. Nice to this to do this ‚Ä¶ Nothing more nothing less.Again we didn‚Äôt ask for anything but if i was a manager and someone was that disappointed in their stay (and a loyalty member) the least i‚Äôd do is send them am email afterwards to try abs keep some brand loyalty‚Ä¶ g  Guess we‚Äôll never stay there again - or maybe any hyatt hotel. The four seasons, Intercon and Banyan tree we stayed at on this trip all LIGHT years ahead.  Go for a function, go for for a business trip ‚Ä¶ DONT GO FOR A HOLIDAY is our view. What a shame :("
